- `app/creation/agencyb2c/yourinformations/page.tsx`
- `app/creation/agencyb2c/yourwinstory/page.tsx`
- `app/creation/agencyb2c/yourfilm/page.tsx`
- And all corresponding reward configuration pages

## Usage Tips

### For Developers
1. **Testing**: Open the console before starting the campaign creation process
2. **Debugging**: Check if all variables are correctly captured at each step
3. **Data Validation**: Verify that the data matches what the user entered

### For QA
1. Use these logs to verify that user data is correctly captured
2. Check that all fields are populated when expected
3. Verify that the flow follows the correct sequence

### Console Filtering
To filter logs in the browser console:
```
Filter: "CREATE CAMPAIGN"
```
This will show only the campaign creation logs.

---

## Log Format

All logs follow a consistent format:
```
=== CREATE CAMPAIGN - [Step Name] ===
Variable Name: Value
Another Variable: Value
==========================================
```

- **Header**: Clearly identifies the step with `===` separators
- **Variables**: Each variable is on its own line with name and value
- **Footer**: Closes the log section with `===` separators

## Notes

- All logs use `console.log()` which appears in the standard browser console
- Variables are captured from React state and localStorage
- Logs only appear when buttons are clicked (on form submission)
- No sensitive payment information is logged
- Logs are only visible in development/testing environments

---

## Maintenance

When adding new fields to the campaign creation process:
1. Add corresponding console.log statements in the button click handlers
2. Follow the same format: `console.log('Variable Name:', value)`
3. Use the same header/footer format for consistency
4. Update this documentation
